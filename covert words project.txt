Goal: make a 'code names' like game that can be played on a browser. 

- Need two devices
- Game is created from a random seed and selection of team (team giving hints, team guessing)
- One team has the target screen (hints), the other team has the board (guessing)
- The guessing can select words by clicking them for a second or two. The latter is to prevent accidental clicks.
- After clicking a tile, the result will show up.
